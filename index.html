                      <p class="font-italic text-muted mb-2">Ruskin Bond is a renowned contemporary Indian author of British descent. Born in 1934, he published his first book ‘The Room on The Roof’ at the age of seventeen for which he was awarded the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize in 1957. Beyond this, Bond has written over 500 short stories, essays, and novellas. Further, he has written more than 40 books for children. It suffices to say that through his avid writing career, Bond has had a sizable impact on Indian literature. He received the Sahitya Akademi Award for English writing in India in 1992, the Padma Shri in 1999, the Delhi government’s Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012 and Padma Bhushan in 2014 for his contribution to literature1. Many of his books are based in or around the towns of Dehradun and Mussoorie at the foothills of the himalayas. </p>

                      <h4 class="font-italic mb-4">Books</h4>
                      <p class="font-italic text-muted mb-2">Ruskin Bond’s first book, ‘The Room on The roof’ which was followed by the book ‘Vagrants in The Valley’ are coming-of-age stories which follow the 17 year-old protagonist, Rusty in his adventures across the city of Dehradun. Like a quintessential book centered around an adolescent protagonist, the book deals with multiple literary themes such as isolation, loneliness, self-doubt, and identity crisis. 
                        <br>As the author weaves for us this Dehradun that Rusty and his friend live in, he very vividly describes multiple aspects of Dehradun that show the readers how the town of Dehradun organically developed into a city in post-colonial India. Through its bazaars, hills, maidaans, and street vendors, Ruskin tells the story of an ambitious India that is ready to leave behind its colonial past and all the more ready to embrace an uncertain future that is full of opportunities.

                      <h4 class="font-italic mb-4">Ruskin writes about his childhood in Dehradun</h4>
                      <p class="font-italic text-muted mb-2">“Formally, it’s known as Dehradun, but in the 1940s and 1950s, when we were young, everyone called it Dehra.
                        <br>That’s where I spent much of my childhood, boyhood, and early manhood, and it was the Dehra I wrote about in many of my books and stories.
                        <br>It was very different from the Dehradun of today—much smaller, much greener, considerably less crowded; sleepier too, and somewhat laid-back, easy-going; fond of gossip, but tolerant of human foibles. A place of bicycles and pony-drawn tongas. Only a few cars; no three-wheelers. And you could walk almost anywhere, at any time of the year, night or day.”
                        <br>(Excerpt from the introduction to 'A Town Called Dehra')

The boy plunged into the throng of bustling people; the road was hot and close, alive with the cries of vendors and the smell of cattle and ripening dung. Children played hopscotch in alleyways or gambled with coins, scuffling in the gutter for a lost anna. And the cows moved leisurely through the crowd, nosing around for paper and stale, discarded vegetables; the more daring cows helping themselves at open stalls. And above the uneven tempo of the noise came the blare of a loudspeaker playing a popular piece of music."

The cinema, where as a boy I saw Abbot and Costello comedies, and classics such as Key Largo and The Maltese Falcon, switched over to Hindi movies in the 1950s and later to soft porn—films with exotic titles such as Dark Blue Nights and Bedroom Follies, purported to be foreign but actually made down south.”

It had been made a recreational center for war-weary Allied troops, and there were large contingents of British and American soldiers stationed on the outskirts. As a result, cafés, dance-halls, bars and even a couple of ‘nightclubs’ sprang up all over the place, and the subsequent revelry continued until the early hours of each morning.”
